\begin{abstract}
Nowadays the CPU has multiple cores and it's becoming common for software 
developers to utilize those computing resources to increase the performance of their applications.
However, parallel programming is much more difficult than writing a sequential program, 
especially when complex parallel patterns exist in the application. 
In this paper, we introduce Cpp-Taskflow \cite{cpp-taskflow}, a header-only library that is implemented in
modern C++17 that aims to help quickly develop a parallel application. Cpp-Taskflow lets 
users build dependency task graphs to express their parallel patterns in a intuitive way 
and it is header-only which enables easier drop-in integration into existing applications.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec::introduction}
Parallel computing is getting increasingly prevalent and important as a single
chip now can accomodate multiple processing units and is no doubt a pivotal
component in building high-performance software. 
Parallel computing is also very useful to EDA applications as the recent
trend~\cite{stok}\cite{Lu2018} shows the EDA tools gain significantly speedup
by scaling to multicores.  Programming a parallel application is a challenging
task because of the indeterministic nature of the concurrent thread execution.
The parallelism might lead to unexpected result if one does not properly
control the execution flow.  
Therefore, compared to writing sequential code, developers need to devote 
more efforts to correctly implement a parallel program.

C++ is the most widely used programming language for developing EDA
applications due to its high performance and it has included essential
facilities to support parallel computing in the standard library ~\cite{cpp-thread}, such as the
\textit{thread} object, \textit{mutex}, \textit{lock} and etc.  The standard
library enables the programmers to build the parallel applications from scratch 
but it is not scalable primarily because of the low-level thread managements.
Several libraries are invented to aid the the development of parallel program such as 
OpenMP~\cite{openmp} and Intel Thread Building Blocks (TBB)~\cite{tbb}. 

%Therefore, developers need to devote substantial
%efforts to write a parallel applications.
